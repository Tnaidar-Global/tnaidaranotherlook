                    <p>
                        With the advent of Twitter in 2006, hashtags rose to popularity, allowing users to explore and keep up with current trends in real-time.
                        <br>
                        With that ability came the opportunity for Trendjacking, where brands and other 3rd parties hijack current trends to ride the wave and give themselves a boost in exposure, sometimes hopping on the bandwagon can be beneficial for your brand.
                        <br>
                        The trending topic can be in any form, a piece of news, a hashtag, slang term, event or even memes. It’s a very easy way for your brand to grab attention or start a conversation with your following, but perfectly balanced timing, messaging and execution are crucial to successful trendjacking.
                        <br>
                        Back during the 2013 Super Bowl, an American football game, a power outage plunged half of the stadium into darkness and became a controversial topic for days and months to come.
                        <br>
                        Oreo was one of the earliest and most successful trend jackers, during the blackout, their creative team took mere minutes to come up with this viral tweet that received almost 14,000 retweets and over 6700 likes with their creative agency receiving multiple awards as well.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Oreo pretty much set the gold standard for trendjacking and numerous companies followed suit, some went viral and some went viral for all the wrong reasons.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</span>
                    <p>
                        If you had an online presence in 2015, you could not have missed the entirety of the internet going back and forth about #thedress, which at its peak on Twitter had over 10,000 tweets per minute and totalled over 11 million tweets! 
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        As expected many brands hopped on the bandwagon and put their spin on the situation.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Even Adobe capitalized on the trend and offered a more logical answer to the confusion.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        These are a few examples of brands being on their ‘A game’ and capitalizing on a trend, some brands, unfortunately, end up trying too hard and painting themselves in a bad light.
                        <br>
                        Missing the mark like this can lead to consequences ranging from bad to downright disastrous.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        In December of 2013 SpaghettiOs made the grave mistake of tweeting “Take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us.” with their cheerful mascot holding the American flag, almost sounding like a mockery of the event which killed over 2400 and resulted in America entering WW2.
                        <br>
                        The tweet unsurprisingly sparked an immediate backlash, the brand was quick to realize its mistake and issued an apology in a follow-up tweet, but damage control can only do so much in these situations, a more respectful approach to the solemn occasion would have had the intended effect.
                        <br>
                        In 2013, the telecommunications giant, AT&T made the blunder of trying to sound overly commercial and tone-deaf on the eve of the 9/11 tragedy by tweeting an image of a phone with floodlights symbolizing where the Twin Towers stood.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The audience on Twitter was in agreement that this was an advert being passed off as a tribute, and saw it as a backhanded attempt to capitalize on the emotions surrounding the tragedy. The post was deleted within an hour of being put up and an apology was subsequently issued.
                        <br>
                        If you do make any mistakes as such, you must realize the gravity of the situation and implement damage control as effectively as possible by issuing a heartfelt apology and try to resonate with your following.
                        <br>
                        In the case of AT&T, the apology was perceived as lacking emotion and left everybody harbouring ill feelings toward the brand and takes the cake as one of the worst known attempts of trendjacking.
                        <br>
                        As a brand, it’s important that you identify the right trends and capitalize on them and not end up like AT&T. At this point, you may be asking...

                        Now that you know what tools to use, let’s move on to a few questions that’ll ensure you don’t end up like AT&T or SpaghettiOs.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Questions To Ask Before You Trendjack</span>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">Are we on time?</span>
                    <p>
                        A little too late is much too late. Sending out your message while the trend is still relevant is important, any later and your brand risks being seen as boring.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">Are we overdoing it?</span>
                    <p>
                        While trendjacking can boost your brand awareness it’s best to keep an eye on how often you’re doing it, as if you’re constantly sending out messages that don’t add value to your brand and don’t encourage engagement, it could result in your audience losing interest.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">Is it in line with our brand?</span>
                    <p>
                        This is the most important question as if the topic you want to hijack doesn’t line up with your brand and its values, and if you have to shift your tonality completely to hop on the bandwagon, you should reconsider the post entirely.
                        <br>
                        That doesn’t mean you have to strictly stay in line. You can still use the opportunity as long as the message and topic can be delivered using your brand’s tonality and strike your following as humorous and clever
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Conclusion</span>
                    <p>
                        Trendjacking can be a fun and highly effective way to go viral and strike a chord with your fans, and it seems to be here to stay.
                        <br>
                        It requires your brand to be on point and recognize breaking news topics as they go off and respond rapidly to come up with a creative post to ride the wave, good written content, timing and creativity are invaluable for aspiring trendjackers.
                        <br>
                        Always run the content through your creative teams so that you can call it off if there are any negative feelings before you give it the green light.
                        <br>
