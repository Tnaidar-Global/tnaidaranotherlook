                        Buyer Personas play a vital role in making informed decisions and smarter investments.

                        Creating a Buyer Persona can seem like a simple task, but in reality, it requires time, research and a lot of tweaking to perfect your ideal persona.
                        <br>
                        If you’ve spent any amount of time in the marketing sphere, you’ve probably heard the term ‘buyer persona’ being thrown around. In fact, 90% of companies are already using buyer personas to gain a clearer understanding of their customer base.
                        <br>
                        What is a persona? It’s a fictional character or model created to represent certain user types that may interact with your site, product or service and are used in user-centred design and marketing strategies.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">How Can Buyer Personas Help Make Strategic Marketing Decisions</span>
                    <p>
                        A buyer persona can help give you an in-depth understanding of your customers and prospects, and unravel the secrets of what drives them to choose one brand over the other. These insights will also help you:
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Craft better and more relevant content/messaging.</li>
                            <li>Formulate your content strategy based on their buyer journey.</li>
                            <li>Establish a personalized, customer-centric brand experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what exactly can you do with a persona and the insights you gain from its attributes?                    
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Craft better and more relevant content/messaging.
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Your buyer persona should also point out areas or communities where your ideal customers gather thus providing insight into the channels that you should target with your focused content.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Fine-tune your customer segmentation
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Your marketing strategy should be laser-focused, not scattered like a disco ball. A buyer persona helps add essential details that boost your strategy and help brings in more leads.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Personalize your brand
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Once you arm yourself with the knowledge of your prospects and their pain points, you can target & adapt your message, content and offerings to be more appealing.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also possible to formulate a ‘negative’ buyer persona, a theory that helps you represent who you’d rather not have as a customer. This can include.
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Prospects that could prove too expensive to convert</li>
                            <li>Individuals who are too advanced for your offerings</li>
                            <li>Students who are merely interacting with your services for research purposes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are a few examples of brands that did well once they understood their audience using the power of buyer personas.
                        <br>
                        Singapore Life, a life insurance company has understood the nature of someone looking for an insurance policy and has adapted their website to suit.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The website is clean and simple, highlighting a few key points with minimal copy, thus appealing to a spontaneously driven crowd.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The brand has understood its audience and implemented clear Calls To Action (CTA’s) that direct their instinctive prospects to engage with them.
                        <br>
                        Buyer personas are still a relatively new concept in the B2B marketing space, and many companies are still learning how to effectively create and target the right personas while adapting their content to suit their needs.

                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>171% increase in marketing-generated revenue</li>
                            <li>900% increase in visit duration</li>
                            <li>46% increase in conversions</li>
                            <li>100% increase in the number of pages visited</li>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of all this, this feat was achieved by a marketing team of just 4 individuals. Creating buyer personas is not a complicated task by any means, let’s clear up a few common misconceptions in this regard.                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Not Applicable for both B2B & B2C
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Some believe that buyer personas are only applicable for the B2C segment, but as seen in the case of NetProspex, they can and will show results for B2B entities as well. 
                                        <br>
                                        The only thing to note for B2B’s is that your persona would be better if it caters to the DMU (Decision Making Unit) of the targeted organizations, as most company decisions are made collaboratively.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Personas can be created with fictional data
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Going ahead with this assumption can have disastrous consequences, you have to observe your customers actions and collect real data from all possible outlets.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Personas reflect a brand’s personality
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Your brand’s personality is how you present yourself to the world, your brand personas are who you want to cater to.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Personas are a ‘set-and-forget’ strategy
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>A buyer persona is something that will need to be tweaked as you continue to learn more about your customers.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’ve gone over what a buyer persona is, what it can do for you as well as some common misconceptions, now it’s time to take a look at how you can craft one for yourself.

                    <span class="blogTitle">Creating A Buyer Persona</span>
                    <p>
                        In order to go about creating a buyer persona, you must first do plenty of research, put out surveys and conduct interviews as and when necessary.
                        <br>
                        This must be done with customers, prospects and even those out of your contact database who are likely to align with your target audience. Let’s go through a few rational methods that’ll help you gather all the information you need.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interview customers and prospects on what they like most about your product/ service</li>
                            <li>Release targeted surveys that will help you look at your brand through the eyes of a broader audience.</li>
                            <li>Capture important information that can help build personas through forms on your website such as company size, position etc.</li>
                            <li>Consider feedback from your sales teams regarding the leads they deal with, this can help you generalize your personas better.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Wrap Up</span>
                    <p>
                        Crafting buyer personas are crucial for fine-tuning your marketing efforts, they help you pinpoint the ideal customers to be marketing to and how to go about it.
                        <br>
                        Never make assumptions when it comes to personas, always be data-driven, draw your conclusions based on surveys, interviews and plenty of research. The only time it’s ever safe to make assumptions is when you have ample data about your clients and prospects.
                        <br>
                        Remember that buyer personas are constantly evolving as buying behaviour changes with the times, and as such, you should be actively tweaking your personas with newfound data to maintain your competitive edge.
