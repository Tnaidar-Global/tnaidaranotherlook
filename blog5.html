                        A Meme? In your marketing strategy?
                        <br>
                        Absolutely. Given that our lives are so digitally infused, it’s almost hard to go a day without coming across a meme on the interwebs. A social media survey by YPulse found that <a href="https://thenextscoop.com/meme-marketing/" target="_blank"> 55% of 13-35-year-olds send memes on a weekly basis—and 30% send them daily</a>.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        If you decide to use memes in your marketing strategy it’s best to be timely and structured well to resonate with your audience.
                        <br>
                        Fair warning, memes will not achieve their intended effect if your brand’s goodwill depends on maintaining a professional sense of character, it’s best to stay away from meme marketing if that is the case.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Where did memes come from?</span>
                    <p>
                        The origin of the meme has been traced as far back as 3 B.C, with the word being coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawson in 1976. He described memes as a way to share ideas and trends within certain groups. Over time, other groups catch on to one format and make them their own by adding a unique spin to it.
                        <br>
                        As memes are a visual portrayal of feelings, thoughts and ideas, they can be used by marketers to create engagement and form a community by communicating to them through inside jokes. 
                        <br>
                        Now let’s take a look at how you can use memes to your advantage
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">How Can Memes Help Your Brand</span>
                    <p>
                        The concept of meme marketing works, especially if you’re targeting Gen Z or a younger audience in general. 
                        <br>
                        Gen Z is known for almost being allergic to ads, so traditional forms of advertising aren’t going to work with them, using memes to show your fun, youthful side is what draws them in.
                        <br>
                        Millennials spend over 200 minutes online every day. And they’re surely sharing a meme or two while they’re at it. This gives you many opportunities to engage with your following. For free!
                        <br>
                        Why would you spend hundreds of dollars on marketing campaigns when you could do some meme marketing by yourself? You must practise caution and stay relevant, as making a mistake here can make your brand seem archaic and boring, and the internet isn’t exactly the most forgiving place on earth.
                        <br>
                        Here are a few brands that are meme-ing their way to higher levels of engagement.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Meme Marketing Done Right</span>
                    <p>
                        There’s no better place to leverage the visual aspect of memes than on Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barkbox/" target="_blank">BarkBox</a> , a subscription service for dog owners uses memes to resonate with dog owners by making inside jokes that can be perceived by the community and even just using memes to create humour.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Here we can see BarkBox taking a jab at the current WFH situation many of us are facing. This post gained almost 14,650 likes and 141 comments where people talked of how their dogs are a cute distraction to their otherwise boring Zoom calls.
                        <br>
                        Barkbox relates their memes to current situations and themes such as the problems dog owners face, these keep their audience engaged by fostering an exclusive community around them.
                        <br>
                        You can also jump on the bandwagon of current trends and use them to get people talking about your brand, as was the case when IKEA capitalized on the viral image of US Senator Bernie Sanders at the Presidential Inauguration earlier this year.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        This masterpiece of marketing was concocted by Ogilvy Greece and attempted to encourage customers to imitate the politician’s sullen look with their offerings.
                        <br>
                        IKEA is well seasoned in the use of memes and viral marketing. When they picked up on the news that the costume designers of the hit TV series ‘Game Of Thrones’ were using their rugs to double as capes and pelts for the characters they were quick to cook up an organic marketing stunt by decking out some of their employees out with the rugs.
                        <br>
                        This resulted in over 5400 reactions and well over 1100 comments and shares. It’s safe to say they have pop culture marketing down to a science.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Memes don’t have to be pictures, many brands have picked up on the trend of video memes and created viral content. In fact, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/infographic-videos-shared-12x-more-than-texts-photos-liked-2x-more-than-text/" target="_blank">videos perform up to 12 times better</a> than any other content.
                        <br>
                        Wonderful Pistachios capitalized on the popularity of ‘Keyboard Cat’, a video meme where a cat is seen playing a catchy tune on a piano, by integrating it into one of their ads. This was a brilliant example of brand integration.

                    <span class="blogTitle">Memes Connect & Entertain your Audience</span>
                    <p>
                        We hinted at this earlier, now let’s dive deeper and find out more
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Meme marketing can be considered a form of viral marketing, in other words, using fast-spreading current trends to appeal to and engage with your viewers. But virality in memes consists of a few essential ingredients.
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Relatability
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Like BarkBox, other brands should also tailor their humour so that their followers can relate to it and feel like they’re being catered to.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Short Text
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Always keep the copy in your memes as short as possible, viewers want to be entertained, not read long sentences.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Use the right visuals
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Using popular visual concepts and not manipulating them too much helps viewers identify and relate to the meme</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Social media users are most engaged when they are entertained, Your brand can even use memes to bring out light-hearted humour on trends in wildly different industries.
                        <br>
                        This neatly brings us on to the topic of Trend Jacking, which is the art of capitalizing on a current trend and making your brand more visible in the digital space. You can keep tabs on news-worthy events and identify trends worth exploiting.
                        <br>
                        The American restaurant chain Denny’s decided to poke some fun at the tech giant Apple on the release of their new Mac Pro, which many likened to a cheese grater in appearance.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Denny’s is no stranger to quirky, offbeat humour, your brand can also craft its brand of humour based on your target audience and their interests. 
                        <br>
                        As seen above, it isn’t always necessary to create memes that link back to your brand, it becomes a repetitive form of advertisement which most younger generations are averse to. Sometimes it’s best to let the meme speak for itself.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Conclusion</span>
                    <p>
                        Memes can be an incredible way of engaging your following when used effectively. Always remember to be original, stay relevant and avoid being tacky. Use them to your advantage and maintain a consistent brand persona.
                        <br>
                        This leads to a more humanized brand & helps you reach a wider following all without the trouble of planning content and doing hours of research.
                        <br>
                        And we can’t deny that memes are just fun anyway.
