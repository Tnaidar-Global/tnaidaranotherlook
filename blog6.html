                    <p>

                        <br>
                        TikTok currently has no way for you to easily link a video back to your website, on the flipside this presents an opportunity for your brand to get creative.
                        <br>
                        The nature of TikTok means that brands have to constantly keep coming up with new content or keeping track of current trends and challenges, cutting through the noise can be a considerable challenge.

                        TikTok & their parent company ByteDance have come under fire for privacy concerns regarding data sharing with China. For the most part, this has now been resolved and is said to pose only as much risk as any other social media application.
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Here are 3 key ways for you to market your brand on the platform.                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is a great way to start a trend of your own, a well-performing challenge can attract millions of user-generated videos, which are in other words, free advertising for your brand. TikTok estimates that over 35% of its user base take part in trending hashtag challenges.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The #ReadySETgo challenge by Laura Mercier is a good example of a successful hashtag challenge, they teamed up with 5 beauty influencers who had a combined reach of over 19 million followers. They created a before & after transition video showcasing the product’s results which resulted in over 8.1 billion impressions and 2500 pieces of UGC.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">2. Collaborate with influencers</span>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, a brand can take its plans to the next level if they team up with credible influencers who have a large following. 
                        <br>

                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">3. Leverage TikTok ads</span>
                    <p>
                        TikTok is the new hotspot for advertising, it has as much reach as Instagram but isn’t drowning with advertisements. This makes it ripe for cost-effective brand impressions.

                            </li>
