                        As a brand, you need to be able to showcase and sell your products and services online.
                        <br>
                        If you’re a mom & pop business, you could just get away with cooking up a website using services like Wix or WordPress and throw in a few themes and plugins to boot, which is more than okay if it meets your needs. However, if you want to make an impact on your visitors, see real results & add value to your marketing strategy, it’s time you turn to a professional Web Design Agency.
                        <br>
                        Investing in a website can be a pretty big undertaking for many organizations, therefore you must do your research and choose an agency that is in line with your values and has your best interests at heart, keeping in mind that over 90% of people tend to leave a website that is poorly designed, unresponsive & slow.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Why is Organic Social Media Important?</span>
                    <p>
                        First off, let’s go through a few things that you should do before approaching an agency.
                        <br>
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>1. Research, research, and more research
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Do plenty of homework, search for agencies online, reach out to your network of contacts and list out several agencies that you deem suitable</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>2. Check out their websites
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>If the agency has a website that is outdated, slow or otherwise unpleasant to use, this usually reflects on their quality of workmanship. Keep looking.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>3. Go through reviews & testimonials
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Delve into their socials, Google reviews and testimonials on their website, take some time to read through and understand the experiences of their past customers</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>4. Make some phone calls
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>By now you’ve probably narrowed down your list to a few agencies, it’s time to pick up the phone and begin talking about working together. A solid agency will be straightforward and answer any questions that you may have in a polite, professional and well-informed manner.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what do you need to ask to vet an agency further? We’ll take you through a series of questions that you can pose to an agency to evaluate their capabilities and make your final decision.                        <br>
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>1. “Do you have prior experience with brands in our industry?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>An important question to start things off, particularly if you work in a specialized area. 
                                        <br>
                                        It isn’t the end however if the agency hasn’t worked with your industry but shows promise and has worked with various other industries, they may be able to bring in their expertise and apply it to your project.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>2. “Do you outsource any portion of your work?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>If an agency outsources large amounts of its work it could mean that additional costs, complexities and scheduling issues could come your way. 
                                        <br>
                                        It isn’t a major issue if the agency outsources certain small pieces of the project, but you must know what portions they outsource.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>3. “What Services do you offer apart from Web Design?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>If an agency can handle most additional jobs that come along with designing a website such as Copywriting, Marketing Strategy, Photo/ Videography in-house it simplifies tasks on both ends and saves you time and money.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>4. “Will you be developing the website from scratch or a template”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>This can also depend on how far your budget will stretch, a custom coded website will require much more time and effort but offer higher degrees of customizability in comparison to templates.
                                        <br>
                                        If you’re paying top dollar, make sure you’re getting a website that is fully customized to your needs
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>5. “What  kind of Content Management System will you use?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>A Content Management System or CMS will be the back end of your website, this is where you will create and modify content on your site. 
                                        <br>
                                        Ensure that your agency is providing you with a highly intuitive and user-friendly CMS that has extensive functionality, do not hesitate to ask for a demonstration before moving forward.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>6. “How will you help us measure site metrics?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Metrics are a key tool to always stay one step ahead, ask your agency what tools they intend to embed or use to help you gauge the traffic to your site.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>7. “How long will the project take and what will payment plans be like?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>It is imperative to have a realistic and measurable timeline for your web project, ask your agency for an estimate of how long a project such as yours can take, and how they plan to demonstrate key milestones
                                        <br>
                                        You should also ask your agency whether payments are flexible and can be paid once a set milestone has been achieved, take note to include this in your final agreement as well.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>8. “What’s included in the cost, and what isn’t?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>A question that can help you avoid unseen expenses and fully understand the agency’s pricing structure.
                                        <br>
                                        None of us like surprises when it comes to bills, so pay close attention to the cost structure and clearly understand what you’re paying for and whether any additional costs could arise.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>9. “Will you provide tech support and maintenance after completion?”
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Always, always ask if an agency will provide after-sales service and be able to provide backups, security and maintenance once the project is complete.
                                        <br>
                                        This is a task better left to the people who designed your website as they know the ins and outs better than anyone else, so ensure that you clarify this point beforehand.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Make The Right Choice</span>
                    <p>
                        If you’ve chosen the right agency, they should be able to answer these questions with ease and be able to explain any unfamiliar terms and break down all the intricacies of building a website and the associated costs, thus giving you some clarity and assurance toward the project.
