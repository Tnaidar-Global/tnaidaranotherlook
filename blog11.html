                        As a brand, you may have faced the dilemma of finding content in the form of images, video and even audio content for your social media posts or campaigns.
                        <br>
                        Today we’re going to share some highly useful resources that will allow you to access a wealth of content that is royalty-free, will add a splash of uniqueness to your content and did we mention FREE?
                        <br>
                        The content that you can find using these resources are public domain content, which means that there are absolutely no copyrights or trademarks on them, there are hundreds of thousands of photographs, slogans, songs etc that can be freely used without having to obtain permission from or compensate the owner.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Video Content</span>
                    <p>
                        Video has proved to be one of the most effective forms of marketing. 78% of video marketers say video has directly helped increase sales.
                        <br>
                        Stock footage can be a crucial tool for making videos, as fillers or even create a complete video, here are a few of our top picks
                    </p>
                    <span class="subTitle">Pexels</span>
                    <p>
                        Pexels provides a great selection of stock footage with resolutions of up to 4K UHD, and all videos can be edited and manipulated as you wish.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Pexels also groups footage into popular collections and trending topics to make it easier for their users to find the right footage quickly and easily. The search function, however, can be a little difficult to use and relies on specific keywords
                    </p>
                    <span class="subTitle">Videvo</span>
                    <p>
                        Videvo has a clutter-free interface and provides a sizeable library of 4K and 1080P footage with a good selection of motion graphics and green screen footage which can be overlaid onto other videoclips for added flair.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Videvo has a simple and hassle-free approach to licensing as most of their content is licensed as royalty-free, meaning that you are free to edit and manipulate the footage as you please without any attributions required.
                        <br>
                        Footage listed under their Videvo Attribution License allows for unlimited use in the same way as royalty-free but requires that you credit the artist in your production.
                    </p>
                    <span class="subTitle">Pixabay</span>
                    <p>
                        Pixabay has an impressive library of free 4K footage to satisfy pretty much any need, what they lack however is some green screen footage which video editors would find quite useful.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The Pixabay License allows you to download and edit content for commercial and non-commercial purposes without attribution. Pixabay does require you to create an account and log in to download full-resolution images and they have also had a few complaints about poor customer service
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Images</span>
                    <p>
                        A striking image can get the attention of your audience and channel their emotions to benefit you, these websites have a plethora of free, public domain images to suit your needs.
                    </p>
                    <span class="subTitle">Unsplash</span>
                    <p>
                        A favourite of everyone here at Tnaidar, Unsplash is our go-to site when we need image content at a moments notice. They have an amazing selection of images and a nifty little ‘Featured’ tab above the search bar that highlights the best of best in categories ranging from tech to architecture to film.                    
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Unsplash has several genres to explore and makes your life easy by having a download button right on the images as you scroll past them. Their license allows you complete reign over what you want to do with the content you download.
                    </p>
                    <span class="subTitle">KaboomPics</span>
                    <p>
                        This site is a diamond in the rough, it has a varied collection of great images and allows you to download the images in custom resolutions, a useful feature to save time when editing.                    
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The only annoyance is that every time you click an image, it opens in a new tab, but they make up for it by having a colour palette next to the image you select, which helps a lot during the editing process to get the most out of your image, this is easily their coolest feature.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <span class="subTitle">NYPL Digital Collections</span>
                    <p>
                        Here’s something out of the norm, the New York Public Library has painstakingly digitized a treasure trove of over 1 million vintage posters, rare images, manuscripts and photographs.                    
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        A good number of the images are listed as free for use and can be used to give your post a retro vibe should the need arise. You can either use the search bar to find images that are listed as ‘public domain’ or browse the homepage for recently digitized content.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Audio Content</span>
                    <p>
                        If you need to make a video, you’re going to need a suitable soundtrack to go along with it, fortunately for you, there are plenty of resources to download royalty-free tracks and even some older songs that are now in the public domain which can work well with your video depending on the direction you’re trying to go in.
                    </p>
                    <span class="subTitle">MUSOPEN</span>

                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>

                        Incompetech has a huge collection of soundtracks for free, featuring a host of tracks from the legendary Kevin Macleod and many others.
                    </p>
