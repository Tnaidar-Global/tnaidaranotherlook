                        If you’re reading this blog, it’s quite likely that you may have been searching for topics related to Search Engine Optimization. 
                        <br>
                        Search Engine Optimization plays a vital role in driving traffic to your website and increasing your web visibility by putting you higher up on the SERP (search engine results page).  
                        <br>
                        Regardless of what search engine you used, you wouldn’t have been sent here by chance, this blog would have been among the millions of pages indexed under your topic and was shown on your results in hope of being one of the best answers to your query.
                        <br>
                        61% of marketers say improving SEO and growing their organic presence is their top inbound marketing priority. Would you ever risk being part of the remaining 39% who get left behind?
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Why Care About SEO?</span>
                    <p>
                        There’s no use in advertising and promoting yourself elsewhere if you haven’t properly optimized your website. Not performing proper SEO is equal to throwing leads away.
                        <br>
                        People could be searching for a product or service like yours but have no idea you exist, without proper SEO you’ll never have a chance to show them why you’re better than the rest. Your competition probably loves the fact that you’re not putting in the work.
                        <br>
                        Moreover, search engines aren’t perfect, not by a long shot. If your website inadvertently has any of the following issues it could fail regardless of the effort you put into other SEO efforts.
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Duplicate pages

                            </li>
                            <li>Improper link Structure

                    <span class="blogTitle">What Can SEO Do For You?</span>
                    <p>
                        Search Engine Optimization brings a whole host of benefits for modern businesses, not only does SEO optimize discoverability, but it also increases your website’s level of usability.
                        <br>
                        Here are a few things that SEO can do for you
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Higher Visibility & Ranking
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Visibility correlates to ranking. The higher you appear on the SERP, the more likely you are to be visible to your prospects. You must rank as high as possible, as nearly 33% of internet users never go past the first page.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Drive More Web Traffic
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Driving more traffic to your website is one of the cornerstones of SEO, by increasing your visibility and ranking you begin to drive traffic to your website. A study by Chitika, an online ad network showed that 75% of clicks go to the first five listings.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Increase Brand Awareness
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>With increased web traffic comes an increase in brand awareness, this will eventually lead to a boost in revenue.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Increase in Authority
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>This is a relatively new concept in the world of SEO but is rapidly gaining importance with web users and search engines. Authority pertains to the level of trustworthiness, quality and relevance that your website has, with more authority comes a higher SERP rank and an increased level of trust in your brand.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Faster Page Load Times
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>SEO pushes you to prioritize the speed of your website, a faster page load time helps web users find content faster and reduces the likeliness of them losing interest in you.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work you put into SEO eventually results in you having a more responsive website with faster load times, resulting in lower bounce rates and a higher SERP ranking.
                        <br>
                        In the end, SEO will help you build a better relationship with your audience by giving them a better experience in finding and exploring your offerings.

                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Crucial Elements of SEO</span>
                    <p>
                        <ul class="mainList">

                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>When SEO was still in its early stages, keywords were all that came to mind when the topic came up. In today’s modern world, they must be researched and used carefully, as they still hold their importance,
                                        <br>
                                        A pro tip for finding keywords is to use ones with high search rates for your industry and to focus on short-tail keywords (phrases with one word), for example using the word ‘egg’ instead of using ‘make scrambled eggs.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Content
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>The content you use is a key part of your SEO strategy. If you were a digital marketing agency, and you also provided helpful and informative blogs on topics such as building brand identity & using social media analytics more effectively you would be the first agency to come to mind when that prospect wants requires such services.</li>
