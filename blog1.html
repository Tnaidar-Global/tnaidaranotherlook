                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Introduction</span>

                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">How can Content Marketing help my brand?</span>
                    <p>
                        Content marketing can cost you 62% less in comparison to traditional means yet generate up to 3X more leads.(G2, 2021) 
                        <br>
                        So how you can transform into an authoritative brand with the help of Content Marketing?
                        <br>
                        Here are 6 proven tactics to get you going.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">1. Use your content to answer questions</span>
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Becoming a brand with authority is nigh impossible If you ignore the questions of your audience. 
                        <br>
                        Creating on-site content that is relevant to your brand helps raise awareness for your brand and positions you as an industry expert in the eyes of those yet unaware of your existence and builds trust and credibility with those who are.
                        <br>
                        Blogger and speaker Robbie Richards grew his web traffic to 272% in just 30 days by creating useful, in-depth and actionable content and promoting it successfully by targeting the right segments for his content
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/1.png" alt="">
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Companies that choose to blog are rewarded with 97% more links to their websites. If your brand has a blog or is on the fence about starting one, dive in headfirst and begin creating engaging content that gives information about your brand and your industry.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">2. Unearth meaningful information & insights</span>
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Creating content based on studies & reports that are newsworthy demonstrates that you are committed to bringing new information to light.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Conducting surveys, studies and reports of your own provides immense value to your audience by enlightening them to new insights and data, in other words, performing data journalism. 
                        <br>
                        This also gives you the added benefit of having an abundance of content that can be pitched to the media eventually boosting your brand authority and introducing your brand to a wider audience.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">3. Collaborate with authoritative brands & figures</span>
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Working with notable individuals that have a large following to create content helps you reach a much wider audience, generate more leads and drive sales. 
                        <br>
                        Finding the right individuals that suit your brand image is key as they will be the face of your campaign. 
                        <br>
                        Brands can also collaborate with other recognized brands to increase market share, share insights and eventually reach a wider customer base resulting in higher profits. One instance of brand collaboration was when the automotive titan, Ford chose to collaborate with Tinder, one of the most well-known dating apps of our time. 
                        <br>
                        Their joint campaign involved setting up a dating profile that stated “Swipe right if you fancy a blind date in a Ford Mustang”, with the reward being a carpool karaoke-style blind date.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/3.png" alt="">
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        The profile saw 1.5 million interactions and resulted in 5 lucky couples being picked for the blind date where the couples drove around London while being quizzed by comedy star Jarred Christmas.
                        <br>
                        Ford also took the opportunity to make a promotional video that has over 30,000 views to date. This collaboration resulted in a massive boost in reach and exposure for both brands. For those interested, Hubspot has compiled a list of 21 successful collaborations here.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">4. Leverage the power of Social Media</span>
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Even in 2021, many brands have not taken advantage of the capabilities of social media to their fullest. 
                        <br>
                        Social media is a free way to build an online presence and provides opportunities to connect with customers, influencers and potential business partners. 
                        <br>                        
                        Having a presence on social media allows you to easily share knowledge and meaningful content while ensuring it reaches a wider audience, it also means that you have a platform to publicly address questions or criticisms regarding your brand whenever they arise.                        
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogsubTitle">5. Take every opportunity to display social proof</span>
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Always use social proof such as testimonials and online reviews to enhance your credibility in the eyes of your prospects and visitors
                        <br>
                        This provides visitors with the chance to observe the impact that you have made on others and explore what you have to offer.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/4.png" alt="">
                    <p class="subtopicBody">
                        Another amazing example of leveraging social proof was when RCA Victor (Radio Corporation of America) released a platinum hit collection titled “50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can’t Be Wrong”.
                        <br>
                        It was essentially telling potential buyers “How could you go wrong investing in something that over 50 million people had already bought”.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">In Conclusion</span>
                    <p>
                        Building an authoritative brand will not be without effort, however, the time, money and effort you invest into developing a content marketing strategy and putting out value-added content for your audience will pay dividends in due course.
                        <br>
                        Over time this will result in your brand becoming more memorable and trustworthy in the public eye.
