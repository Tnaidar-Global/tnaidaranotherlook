                    <p>
                        You may recall that we briefly touched on social proof in our previous article, user-generated content or customer content is one of the finest forms of social proof there is.
                        <br>
                        According to the State of UGC 2021 Report by TINT, “93% of marketers agree that consumers trust content created by customers more than content created by brands”, in other words, people trust people.
                        <br>
                        You might still be wondering.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">What can User-Generated Content do for me?</span>
                    <p>
                        User-generated content generates more leads, builds trust and fosters customer loyalty. UGC has become the new normal for many brands, it might just be safer to walk on thin ice rather than ignore this trend and not invest in it.    
                        <br>
                        Your brand should focus on leveraging UGC if you are seeking sustainable growth, especially in saturated markets. 
                        <br>
                        Brands that do have found that customers love to engage with their brands in a very visual manner, most commonly on platforms like Instagram & TikTok, with content ranging from before/after shots, reviews, walkthroughs and even extend to more refreshing and unusual forms of content.
                        <br>
                        Adopters of content marketing are also rewarded with conversion rates that are up to 6X higher than their competitors, it’s a known fact that getting there requires a significant investment of time, money & skill but the magnitude of conversion rates that it can drive when done right is more than what any traditional marketing techniques can yield.
                        <br>
                        Now, onto the next topic for today.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">How has Social Media Evolved?</span>
                    <p>
                        Social media used to be about who shouted the loudest and longest, that is no longer the case, the way consumers use social media has changed with leaps and bounds, our feeds are set alight by different brands all vying for our attention.
                        <br>
                        <i>The only way to stand tall in this sea of noise is to have a content strategy that prioritizes being authentic and people-centric.</i>
                        <br>
                        Brands need to stop treating social media as an afterthought and harness its power to grow their digital presence, thereby making it easier to be discovered.
                        <br>
                        In this day and age, consumers on social media have made it clear that they want a bona fide relationship with their favourite brands and want to feel noticed by them. If your brand can take note of this and interact with your audience in such a manner that it embeds you in their midst.
                        <br>
                        This creates a brand personality that leads to you having a louder social voice than any of your competitors. This outlook ensures that you foster customer loyalty, something that is paramount in these uncertain times.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">How can UGC help my brand?</span>
                    <p>
                        User-generated content helps portray you as a customer-centric brand that spotlights the people that have shaped you, this leads you to a position where you’re no longer marketing to them, you’re marketing with them.
                        <br>
                        The availability of UGC is a boon to marketing budgets, which are stretched paper-thin in most cases, the costs associated with customer content are minimal at best and is an ever-growing resource that can be tapped into on a massive scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s look at what else UGC can do for you
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>UGC allows you to grow your digital presence exponentially by leveraging customer content</li>
                            <li>Get more out of your marketing budgets.</li>
                            <li>Using customer content also communicates your openness to listen to audience opinions.</li>
                            <li>It makes you seem sincere and transparent</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If as a brand you ever feel like you’re short on content or just want to light a fire under the hearth of content creation to get your brand name buzzing you can begin promoting an online competition or campaign with a clear call to action, this can lead to some viral moments for you with very minimal effort.
                        <br>
                        Brands such as Sephora, Fenty, Starbucks and even BMW have understood and taken advantage of the power of UGC. 
                        <br>
                        Fenty was one of the earliest brands to adopt and capitalize on TikTok by setting branded challenges for their followers. Truth be told, we find it puzzling that only 11.8% of organizations plan to increase their activity on TikTok in 2021.
                        <br>
                        GoPro took this concept and absolutely went to town on it, their killer strategy of incentivizing UGC with their GoPro Awards programme which gives provides their audience with prizes, gear and even cash awards to keep their content firehose going. 
                        <br>
                        Their Million Dollar Challenge offers users an equal share of a 1 million USD prize pool for those that submit winning clips for their year-end highlight reel. Their strategy is unique in that it never showcases the product at any point but highlights what its toughest users are doing with it.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <span class="blogTitle">Conclusion</span>
                    <p>
                        The benefits of moving toward customer-centric campaigns are extensive, and that's putting it mildly, user-generated content brings in an unprecedented level of engagement and awareness even though the content is created without much brand direction.
                        <br>
                        The biggest advantage for a brand is that content created by a customer is unique and inimitable. Experiment with handing over a little brand power to your audience and tap into an endless source of creativity, the rewards are immense!
                        <br>
                        We hope this article gives you an idea about how UGC can help impact your brand, and we would love to hear your questions, comments and experiences in the comments below!
