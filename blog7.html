                        You could have an amazing marketing strategy that could bring in leads and revenue like no tomorrow, but how do you measure your performance? 
                        <br>
                        With metrics of course.
                        <br>
                        Not many companies properly track, measure and optimise their marketing efforts based on their results. The old way of defining success on digital media was to measure how many people would see an ad or the number of clicks it would generate.
                        <br>
                        Metrics matter as they are a clear cut way to measure the success of your efforts, from social media growth, SEO progress or your digital marketing performance overall. Having measurable marketing metrics can help you ensure that your brand is on the right path.
                        <br>
                        With the current state of the digital landscape, merely measuring clicks doesn’t cut it anymore. The advent of smartphones has reshaped the way customers and prospects interact with a brand and has changed the way we need to measure its impact. 
                        <br>
                        To provide solid documentation for growth and return on investment (ROI), marketers should shift their focus onto updating their measurement strategies and KPI’s to survive in a mobile dominant world.
                        <br>
                        When it comes to analytics tools, we’re inundated with a seemingly endless amount of data, but does all the data matter? Does having more data mean faster growth?
                        <br>
                        No.
                        <br>
                        Some types of data can fool us into thinking that we’re on the right path, as a brand you need to focus on actionable metrics.

                    <p>
                        What are vanity metrics?
                        <br>
                        They’re the kinds of data that make us feel good, Many brands and marketers usually get carried away with vanity metrics, which show big numbers but aren’t of any real value and don’t help us make informed marketing decisions.
                        <br>
                        Seth Godin said it best when he said, “Those clicks, views, and ‘likes’ are only there because they’re easy, not relevant.” 
                        <br>
                        They’re nothing but a case of smoke and mirrors. It might provide you with massive figures to flaunt online but isn’t giving you an insight into how your brand is performing. Having too much faith in vanity metrics can lead you to believe that your brand is doing well while it isn’t, this could seriously impact you in the long run.
                        <br>
                        Here are some vanity metrics that aren’t worth your time.
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Follower count & Likes on social media</li>
                            <li>Number of product users</li>
                            <li>Page views</li>
                            <li>Number of articles, posts published</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a brand, you need to ask yourself a few questions when it comes to these metrics                        <br>
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>“Is it bringing us closer to our business goals?”</li>
                            <li>“Do they help us understand customer behaviour?”</li>
                            <li>“Can we make an informed marketing decision with this data?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Did you say “No” all three times? Then it’s time to move on to the metrics that matter.
                        <br>
                        Actionable metrics are the kinds of data that help you determine what actions are yielding results and use these metrics to come up with a game plan to scale your brand further.
                        <br>
                        These metrics also answer all the questions we asked earlier, with a resounding “Yes”. They can tell you what led you to your current state and how. Actionable metrics aren’t left to chance, they are a result of factors that are actually within our control.
                        <br>
                        Windstream, an advanced network communications provider consolidated all of its digital performance data into Nielsen's Marketing Intelligence Platform.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blogImages" src="images/blog/blog1/2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        This enabled the brand to discover what tactics were effective at driving conversions and helped optimize them for future marketing efforts. This shift in attention to more actionable metrics resulted in a 31% decrease in cost per sale and a 45% increase in sales volume.
                        <br>
                        The questions you should be asking when you’re looking at actionable metrics are
                        <br>
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>“How does this affect how we gain or lose customers/ revenue?”</li>
                            <li>“Can we act on this data/insight?”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now let’s look at a few metrics that are worth your while</p>
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Conversion volume/ rate</li>
                            <li>Active subscriptions</li>
                            <li>Retention length</li>
                            <li>Number of leads</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even within the scope of actionable metrics, it’s more than possible to get lost in the noise, which brings us to the topic of.
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">How Do You Choose Your Metrics?</span>
                    <p>
                        The metrics you choose will depend on your brand’s objectives and what you want to measure. If you were running a campaign, then you should be tracking campaign-specific metrics such as
                        <br>
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Engagement rate</li>
                            <li>Time spent on page</li>
                            <li>Organic brand search growth</li>
                            <li>Bounce rate</li>
                            <li>Shares on social media</li>
                            <li>New vs returning customers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few good goals to track would be
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Improving SEO</li>
                            <li>Improving brand awareness</li>
                            <li>Improving content quality</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tools like Hootsuite Analytics or even Google Analytics will help you track these actionable metrics once you have decided on your specific goals.
                        <br>
                        Now we mentioned that vanity metrics aren’t of much use, but is there a way to get something out of them after all?
                    </p>
                    <span class="blogTitle">Making Vanity Metrics Actionable</span>
                    <p>
                        All is not lost with vanity metrics, taking some time to delve into the data behind them can help you up your marketing game.
                        <br>
                        Here are a few vanity metrics and the actionable data behind them
                        <br>
                        <ul class="mainList">
                            <li>Impressions and clicks on Social Media
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Though the numbers are of no use, you can go beyond them and use them to better understand what your audience prefers on that channel.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Comments on Social Media
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Comments can be valuable to your brand sentiment and marketing efforts depending on the channel. A 2017 study by Business Insider revealed that people felt safer commenting on LinkedIn over any other channel as people are more likely to be professional and offer constructive criticism.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Traffic
                                <ul class="subList">
                                    <li>Traffic can also be of value depending on where it’s coming from. Those engaging with content that comes from Google searches are more valuable than those that come through Instagram.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s say you have a paid campaign on Facebook. If you find that it’s not doing too well in terms of traffic and sales, how do can you use the vanity metric of traffic to boost your business goal of higher sales?
                        <br>
                        You can identify a low click-through rate (CTR) by looking at your impressions and clicks.
                        <br>
                        If your impressions aren’t reaching the right audience, they won’t be interested in clicking on your post, with that insight you can conclude that you’re reaching the right audience, but not enough of them. This means you need to up your ad spending on Facebook to get more eyes on your content.

                        Inversely, if you have a high number of impressions but a low CTR, then you can conclude that you aren’t reaching the right audience. It might also mean that your content isn’t striking or engaging enough.
                        <br>
                        In situations like this, using vanity metrics in tandem with actionable metrics can help compound your marketing efforts and lead to better engagement over time.

                    <p>
                        There’s absolutely nothing wrong with flaunting your follower count or impressions, but your brand must use them in tandem with actionable metrics to better understand your audience, implement better strategies and have overall growth.
