                        Over its 50 year history, email has grown into an incredibly powerful and cost-effective tool for direct marketing on a massive scale while providing marketers with a way to observe and react to consumer behaviour like never before.
                        <br>
                        As time progressed, more marketers hopped on the email marketing bandwagon leading to inboxes being cluttered with spam messages,  this prompted privacy regulations to be strengthened and made it mandatory for consumers to be able to opt-out of unsolicited messages.
                        <br>
                        The ever-tightening regulations made marketers realize that they needed to engage consumers with their messaging by making it timely and relevant to avoid being blacklisted.

                                    <li>Automation is a lifesaver for marketers, you can leverage more control over your processes with trigger-based emails which are event-based marketing strategies that are launched by a certain trigger on your website eg- abandoning your online shopping cart or searching for relevant topics, this tactic is known to perform 3x better than nurture and batch emails

                        The biggest advantage of email marketing is the level of control that it offers to any organization, you should pay close attention to the churn rate of your mailing lists, in other words, this is the ratio of people subscribing to your mailing list vs unsubscribers.
                        <br>
                        If you have a healthy list, you should be seeing more subscribers than unsubscribers, else it may become fatigued and stale if it’s not replenished with new prospects over time. Make sure to maintain a healthy list and segment them according to the information you’ve gathered about them such as age group, Profession, interests to target them better.
